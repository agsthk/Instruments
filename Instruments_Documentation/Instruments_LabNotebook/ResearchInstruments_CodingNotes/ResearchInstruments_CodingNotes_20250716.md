# structure_rawdata.py
- Following data management discussion from earlier today, I have determined that my structured data will actually be what I upload as raw data
	- As such, I will be changing the variable names to more closely follow ICARTT standards for short variable names
		- [From NASA ESDS](https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/etc/AtmosphericCompositionVariableStandardNames.pdf)
		- I may not follow these exact naming conventions, but I will try to stick closely with them
		- These are not *strict* standards, so no need to be perfect
		- variableName_units, e.g. CH2O_ppm
	- I will also not be dropping any columns **except** for date/time columns after defining UTC datetime
- Revised variable names to be more descriptive
- Revised code to include schema/read in for Teledyne N300
- Split datetime string declaration into separate date and time declarations for data with separate columns for those
- Revised datetime conversion function to work for all non-DAQ data
- Encountered a problem
	- DAQ read in is not reading in the poorly formatted Picarro files, just returning empty dataframes
	- Need to revise exception handling
- Next step with datetime conversion is declaring time zones
	- Theoretically straightforward, although ambiguous timezones due to DST may give trouble
	- Assigned time zones based on dictionary input, with potentially ambiguous timezones being handled by previously written function
		- Function is giving a ComputeError because it says the name "DateTime" is duplicate
			- This is an issue from the pl.exclude("index") in select - passes "DateTime" twice
			- Including "DateTime" in columns to exclude resolves this error
	- Added piece of code that converts datetimes from whatever their initial format is to UTC and local datetimes (as additional columns)
- Deleted all initial code that structured the data individually by instrument
- Checked that datetimes are successfully processed for all non-DAQ files
# Next Time
- Need to have a local datetime column added to DAQ files
- Revise exception handling for DAQ read-in to actually read in the improperly formatted Picarro files
