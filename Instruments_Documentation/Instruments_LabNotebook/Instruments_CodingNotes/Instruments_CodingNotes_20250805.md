# Git repository
- Due to the path length issues, I need to come up with a structure that has a shorter path length
- Considering moving my working project repositories outside of my OneDrive
	- Need to think about how this might work with lab notebooks - I want those backed up, and really I need to be able to document on my MacBook
		- I could use windows remote desktop, that would likely be fine
	- Should I have my documentation backed up by git?
		- I could since it's all markdown files - think about it
- Recreated ResearchInstruments project in agsthk directory on Windows PC and now am going to assess if this will fix the path length issue
	- Renamed "ResearchInstruments" to "Instruments" - I suspect that will do in combination with the change in location
	- Will be trying to use git to backup documentation
