# clean_rawdata.py
- Going to add a column that indicates the start of the current sampling interval for each data point - using fill forward again
	- This will allow for determination of data collected during "crossover" times - they can be removed
- Revised determination of sampling intervals to prevent declaring multiple zero-second intervals
	- Artifact of Picarro DateTime sometimes rounding to the nearest minute
	- Sorted by DateTime, then also by solenoid valve state so that if the state switched at a given time, there is only one location where that change occurs
- Instead of comparing against the next sampling interval stop, I will compare to the stop of the current interval, which will be offset by 20 seconds from when the switch occurs
	- Should remove all data that may be influenced by the switch
	- May elect to offset by more or less time
	- Where there is a transition, the sampling location is None
- Need to investigate why sampling location is None when it should be C200/B203/Exhaust
	- I assume this is an artifact of how I define sampling locations from Picarro
	- This is more complicated than I had anticipated
	- Nothing I do is working!
	- I think using cross joining of DataFrames may be able to help me here - it did
