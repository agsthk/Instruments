# clean_rawdata.py
- To allow for meaningful progress prior to next Megan Meeting, I am initially going to focus on cleaning CO2 data
	- Will allow me to calculate air change rates
- Looked at lab work documentation to get the dates/times that the CO2 monitors were installed/removed for maintenance
	- Considering potentially moving this script to the project directory, but will think more about that later
- For the vent monitor, recalled that the computer time was 12 minutes and 15 seconds ahead of real time, so added line to account for that
	- At 17:43:00 by my watch, computer read 17:55:15
- The install/removal dates will need to be part of an external file in the future, but for now, I will explicitly declare this information in the script
	- The vent monitor was installed from 2025-02-28 17:37 - 2025-03-03 07:05 (local time)
	- I am missing room CO2 data from ~~4/7~~ 4/18 - 4/30
		- I am not sure that this data is valid, and I suspect the Aranet sensors can fill this gap, but I should try to retrieve this data
		- The raw data I copied over was incomplete - should check this for all of the other instruments as well
			- All of the instruments had incomplete data
			- Copied over missing raw data files and will rerun structuring script
		- Based on the figures, the logging started getting really funky on 4/16 around 2 AM
			- There are multiple hour-long gaps throughout
			- 02:16:55 is the last data point recorded at 1 Hz (more or less) frequency
		- I don't believe that retrieving the data beyond what I already have is useful
			- The Aranet sensors should cover the missing data - 1 minute time resolution, which should suffice
			- April 27 is the last date in the shared lab notebook
	- For Phase II, room CO2 data collection started at ~12:40 on 1/9
		- Consistent with the available data
		- On 1/10, CO2 collection off during particle additions from ~11 AM - 5 PM
			- 11:47 - 17:00?
		- Off 2/12 15:04 - 2/13 09:00 for power outage
		- Off 3/17 08:53 - 10:57 for Alli trying to put the monitor on the DAQ
		- 3/18 had to restart to install updates, not back online until 3/23
			- Also the first day that I switched between experiment and instrument room
		- These are all the times CO2 wasn't being recorded in Phase II up until the stop on 4/16
	- I actually suspect it would be better to document *invalid* times, as that would also allow for a note as to the reason for it being invalid
		- Additionally, I suspect it would be a better structure for filtering
- I think I need to be more sure about what I want this script to do
	- Much of what I am doing feels like it would be more appropriate to do in the project folder
# structure_rawdata.py
- Changed datetime offset to occur in this script rather than the cleaning script so as to have the files appropriately split by date
