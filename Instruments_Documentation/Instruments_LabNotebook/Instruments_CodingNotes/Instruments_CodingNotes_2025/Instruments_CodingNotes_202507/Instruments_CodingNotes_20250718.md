# Picking up
- Need to have a local datetime column added to DAQ files
- Revise exception handling for DAQ read-in to actually read in the improperly formatted Picarro files
# structure_rawdata.py
- Added Local_DateTime column to DAQ files
- Working to read in the improperly formatted Picarro DAQ files
	- The issues are:
		- Setting "ignore_errors=True" in the polars read in causes no error to be raised
		- The error that is raised isn't a SchemaError, but a ComputeError
		- When pandas uses whitespace as a delimiter, it splits the UTC_DateTime column
			- I may be able to get around this by not using one space as a delimiter, but instead only multiple spaces, comma, or comma followed by one or more spaces
				- When doing so, MPV position and OutletValve don't get separated
			- This will require more extensive processing than I initially expected
			- Need to modify the schema dictionary to have separate Date and Time columns that I can then combine
				- After combining, must convert to DateTime or pl.from_pandas() with schema_overrides=schema fails
			- There is an incomplete row that makes data type inference and conversion fail
				- Dropping NaN containing rows before conversion should fix this problem - and it does!
- After revising function to appropriately handle the Picarro files, it now does not properly read in the 2B Tech 205 B monitor files with indices
	- Need to revise the try/except block handling
	- Rather than using try/except, I think it's best to initially read in with ignoring the errors, and then move on to the Picarro read in only if the resulting DataFrame is empty
	- This change seemed to resolve the issue
- I am concerned about possibly missing an issue with the read in function, so I would like to check that any empty DataFrames should truly be empty
	- Confirmed that everything that is empty should be empty
	- It is possible that other files have cut off data, but checking is not so straightforward, and I need to consider how to proceed
		- I'm reasonably confident that they are fine now
- After defining DateTimes, want to drop redundant date/time columns
	- Consider all possible Date/Time column labels, make a list, and exclude those?
	- Currently, in define_datetime I have "Date" and "Time" being excluded, but I think it would be better to do all at once
		- Just have a list of columns to exclude towards the end
- After the DataFrames of individual files are read in, the script will concatenate the data from each instrument/source and split by UTC date
	- Will adjust this later to consider averaging time such that it is the start time considered when splitting
- Defined function split_by_date()
	- Does what it says
- Exported split files to structured directories

- Merged combine-fxns into main
- Deleted combine-fxns branch
