# evaluate_leak.py
- Want to get an idea of the background before and after the leak fixed
	- With both possible dates that leak was introduced
	- Going to take within 2 days of before and after leak fixed to visually compare
		- Actually doing within 3 days
	- After looking at June 13 vs June 24 date, leak was definitely introduced June 13 - satisfied with that!
- Want to look at the NOx as well just to have an idea of what effect that might have
	- Only have NOx measurements from B203, but NO is basically zero in that room - presumably similar?
