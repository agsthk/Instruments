# align_timestamps.py
- After some thought, I realized that I don't want to use the valve states that were exported to define UZA start/stop - I want to use the Picarro data
	- That way when I adjust the Picarro timestamps, I end up with adjusted valve state times which will work better
	- Easy change to make
- Uncommented the code to adjust Picarro time drift, seeing what that does
	- Added code to plot outliers
	- After correcting time drift, needed to switch join_asof strategy to forward - seems to move the time to be more real
	- Correcting the time drift may be the only thing I need to do for the Picarro instrument
- After checking that the starts and stops were being appropriately identified, reverted the code back to work with joining and plotting differences
	- Does not appear that I corrected the time drift - maybe need to do the reverse of what I did?
		- Yes, that fixed it!
