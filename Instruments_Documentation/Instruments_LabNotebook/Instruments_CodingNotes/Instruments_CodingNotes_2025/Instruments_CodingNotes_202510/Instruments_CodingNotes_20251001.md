# align_timestamps.py
- After some thought, I realized that I don't want to use the valve states that were exported to define UZA start/stop - I want to use the Picarro data
	- That way when I adjust the Picarro timestamps, I end up with adjusted valve state times which will work better
	- Easy change to make
