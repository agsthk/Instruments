# clean_rawdata.py
- Before Megan meeting, need to have the Phase II sampling locations properly assigned
- Switching from explicit declaration in script to external file read-in
- Adding Phase II timestamps to SamplingLocation files
- Going to plot all of the DAQ data to check timestamps
	- 2BTech_205_A
		- Don't have any documentation on installation which is awesome
		- Definitely on line through 01/19
		- 2025-01-20
			- Restarted twice

		- O3 additions start 20250121
		- 2025-01-27 is when other instruments installed and overflow pump turned on for first time
			- ~11:00 - 12:00
			- Doing something 17:07:11 - 17:24:51 (starts zeroing after?)
				- I believe this is a result of the zeroing sequence starting on startup
			- Zeros not in derived file!
			- 17:24:51 - 17:45:31 - check on Picarro for better timing as possible

		- 2025-05-05
			- Shutdown prep 12:50:18, shutdown 13:03:18
			- Based on H2O, had drierite connected 12:55:46 - 12:57:31 and again 13:02:46 through shutdown
- Sufficiently happy with the sampling location files (I think), revising script to pull the locations from these files instead of hard coding them
	- Using delete.py to check what I've done
		- Looks like it worked! Slay
- Rerunning zero characterization and calibration scripts on new cleaned data
# evaluate_leak.py
- Created new script to look at the ozone additions pre and post fixing the leak in the bypass pump
