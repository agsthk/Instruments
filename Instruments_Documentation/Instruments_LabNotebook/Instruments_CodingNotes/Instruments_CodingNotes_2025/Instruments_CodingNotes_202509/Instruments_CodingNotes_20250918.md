- Want to identify gaps in active zeroing
	- To begin with, considering gaps longer than 6 hours as gaps
	- Considering how to do this - identify within the zeroing itself?
	- Going to identify in the zeroing where the gaps are longer than 6 hours
	- Able to identify active zeroing interval starts and stops based on gaps
	- By combining interval starts and stops, have a DataFrame of the times that zeroing was active
	- There is a problem with the zeros for 2BTech_205_A!
		- Last 2024 zero is reported as not ending until 2025 - is this an issue with sampling locations?
	- Switching to work with Picarro until I figure out what's going on with 2BTech_205_A
		- Missing UZA on Jan 28 ~00:00 UTC
		- In general, appears to work - main issue is missing or unstopped UZA periods
	- Identifying several gaps where zeroing is actively happening
		- I think my next step needs to be addressing whatever is causing the issues in identifying zeros
			- Actually no - can do this later and just work with the incorrect stuff now to make sure the process is correct
- With zeroing active data identified, modifying zero determination
	- When active, using the same interpolation method as before, but leaving as null when inactive
	- Where zeroing not active, calculating temperature based offset for Thermo and O3 instruments
		- Note that column name changes broke the next code block
	- Where temperature correlation not available (Picarro), filling where zeroing inactive with median offset
