# calibrate_instruments.py
- Want to modify output to include a "default" LOD which is the standard deviation of the zero measurements during calibration
- Initially, just identifying the measured STD from zero measurements
- There are some calibrations with multiple zero periods and thus multiple standard deviations
	- For these, I want to do a pooled standard deviation
		- Requires that I know the number of sample points - need to add this to the ODR data
		- Added a "N" column to cal_data to carry forward this information
	- I actually think it would be best to combine all the zeroing periods - mean and standard deviation
		- Calculating the grand mean and pooled STD, then will replace all the zero rows in odr_cal_data with the pooled data
			- Not the time series - just the regression
		- Successfully calculated the pooled mean and standard deviation of the zero measurements, now working to recombine that with the other measurements in the original odr_cal_data DataFrame
		- Had to move the calculation to be after the time series as that one requires the multiple intervals to be separated
	- Successfully combined all multiple zeros into one zero with properly calculated pooled statistics
- To expand on this - could I group all statistics when delivery concentration is the same?
	- Relatively straightforward to do
	- Just need to identify the delivery concentrations that were repeated, then run the same thing as with the zero but replace to concentration to match to with the repeat concentrations
