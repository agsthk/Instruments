# calibrate_instruments.py
- Want to modify output to include a "default" LOD which is the standard deviation of the zero measurements during calibration
- Initially, just identifying the measured STD from zero measurements
- There are some calibrations with multiple zero periods and thus multiple standard deviations
	- For these, I want to do a pooled standard deviation
		- Requires that I know the number of sample points - need to add this to the ODR data
		- Added a "N" column to cal_data to carry forward this information
	- I actually think it would be best to combine all the zeroing periods - mean and standard deviation
		- Calculating the grand mean and pooled STD, then will replace all the zero rows in odr_cal_data with the pooled data
			- Not the time series - just the regression
		- Successfully calculated the pooled mean and standard deviation of the zero measurements, now working to recombine that with the other measurements in the original odr_cal_data DataFrame
		- Had to move the calculation to be after the time series as that one requires the multiple intervals to be separated
	- Successfully combined all multiple zeros into one zero with properly calculated pooled statistics
- To expand on this - could I group all statistics when delivery concentration is the same?
	- Relatively straightforward to do
	- Just need to identify the delivery concentrations that were repeated, then run the same thing as with the zero but replace to concentration to match to with the repeat concentrations
- Now, adding the "default" LOD to the exported results when available
	- Identifying the row where delivery concentration is zero
		- Combined if multiple zero periods
	- Selecting the standard deviation (uncertainty) in the measured concentration and multiplying by 3 to determine a LOD
- Final thing I want to do with this script is fix the averaging time calculation for Picarro - it's always 1 second
	- Issue because sometimes the reported date/time is set to fixed values 100 seconds apart for some unknown reason
	- Where I calculate averaging time, just stating that it is 1s for Picarro instrument
- Quickly checked new ODR figs against saved figs, slope doesn't change significantly, sometimes R2 does and intercept kind of does, but both of those make sense and aren't very important
- Checking SNR figs
	- Look fine in general
