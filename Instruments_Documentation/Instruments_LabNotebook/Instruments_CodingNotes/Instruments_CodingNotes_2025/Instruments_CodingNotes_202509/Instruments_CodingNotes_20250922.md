# calibrate_instruments.py
- Want to modify output to include a "default" LOD which is the standard deviation of the zero measurements during calibration
- Initially, just identifying the measured STD from zero measurements
- There are some calibrations with multiple zero periods and thus multiple standard deviations
	- For these, I want to do a pooled standard deviation
		- Requires that I know the number of sample points - need to add this to the ODR data
		- Added a "N" column to cal_data to carry forward this information
	- I actually think it would be best to combine all the zeroing periods - mean and standard deviation
		- Calculating the grand mean and pooled STD, then will replace all the zero rows in odr_cal_data with the pooled data
			- Not the time series - just the regression
		- Successfully calculated the pooled mean and standard deviation of the zero measurements, now working to recombine that with the other measurements in the original odr_cal_data DataFrame
		- Had to move the calculation to be after the time series as that one requires the multiple intervals to be separated
	- Successfully combined all multiple zeros into one zero with properly calculated pooled statistics
- To expand on this - could I group all statistics when delivery concentration is the same?
	- Relatively straightforward to do
	- Just need to identify the delivery concentrations that were repeated, then run the same thing as with the zero but replace to concentration to match to with the repeat concentrations
- Now, adding the "default" LOD to the exported results when available
	- Identifying the row where delivery concentration is zero
		- Combined if multiple zero periods
	- Selecting the standard deviation (uncertainty) in the measured concentration and multiplying by 3 to determine a LOD
- Final thing I want to do with this script is fix the averaging time calculation for Picarro - it's always 1 second
	- Issue because sometimes the reported date/time is set to fixed values 100 seconds apart for some unknown reason
	- Where I calculate averaging time, just stating that it is 1s for Picarro instrument
- Quickly checked new ODR figs against saved figs, slope doesn't change significantly, sometimes R2 does and intercept kind of does, but both of those make sense and aren't very important
- Checking SNR figs
	- Look fine in general
# calibrate_cleandata.py
- Going in to change the default LOD to the one calculated from the calibration where a fixed LOD is needed (2BTech_205_B)
	- Just a change from using the "mfr_lod" dict to pulling from the calibration results
- Actually, needs to be a bit more complex
	- Different averaging times will have different limits of detection - must account for that
		- 2s averaging time for 2BTech_205_B is like 2x that of the 10s averaging time
	- Creating a separate lod dictionary
	- Going to use a similar joining technique as with the uncertainties, but need to modify to select the desired LOD
		- If only one exists for given averaging time, use that one
		- If more than one exists for given averaging time:
			- First, use the caldate that is being used
			- If that isn't possible, use the maximum LOD (be conservative)
	- Figured out how to select the appropriate LOD for each variable - checking that it works for multiple variables
		- It certainly seems to, although I'm not sure it's going to matter
	- Joined on AveragingTime column to get appropriate LOD for each measured value
