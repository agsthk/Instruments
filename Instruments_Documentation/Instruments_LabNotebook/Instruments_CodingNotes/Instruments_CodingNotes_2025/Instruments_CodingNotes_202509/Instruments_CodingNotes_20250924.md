- Need to fix the zero starts and stops for O3 and NOx - where does this problem arise?
- If I had to guess, it's probably in clean_rawdata.py and has something to do with the sampling locations
- Going to look at characterize_zeros.py first to see if I can find the issue
	- I think I know where it comes from - I assign a sampling interval based on when the sampling location changes, and I think I'm accidentally grouping the end of phase I with phase II when I do that
# characterize_zeros.py
- Revising to try to address the incorrectly identified zero interval between Phase I and Phase II
- Created and switched to a new branch fix_uza_intvs
- Plotting to examine where the long interval is
	- Definitely see it in the graph
- Going to modify to concatenate all data before assigning rle_id
	- Once I do this, the long interval is gone
	- Also checked and this doesn't mess up Picarro zeroing intervals
- Deleting plotting code now that this is fixed
- After merging branches, re-ran code to get updated zero characterization
# evaluate_offset.py
- Going to check offsets now that zero intervals are fixed
- Revising plotting code to visually check different offsets against one another
- Revised to only add the fixed calibration offsets if the instrument was never zeroed during measurements
- Added identification of zeroing active periods to cell that interpolates offsets and LODs
- Added code to visually check LODs
	- Looks odd - figured out why, it was because I was (once again) applying the offset factors to calculate temperature based LOD
		- Fixed
