- Need to create calibration inputs for the Picarro and O3 calibrations I haven't done yet
	- Used Audrey's script and documentation to determine delivery times, concentrations, and uncertainties for Picarro
		- Audrey did not take into account the delivery uncertainty
	- Having trouble identifying the times for the ozone monitors because they look to be automated
	- Constructed rough interactive plots to identify calibration times
	- Running script and checking outputs to make sure they look reasonable
		- They do! There's a temperature concern with the Picarro, so changing the first zero to start a little later
- Now I have updated calibrations :)
