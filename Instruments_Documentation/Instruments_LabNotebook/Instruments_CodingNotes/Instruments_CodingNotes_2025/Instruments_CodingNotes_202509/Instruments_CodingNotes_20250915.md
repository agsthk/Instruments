# calibrate_instruments.py
- Need to create calibration inputs for the Picarro and O3 calibrations I haven't done yet
	- Used Audrey's script and documentation to determine delivery times, concentrations, and uncertainties for Picarro
		- Audrey did not take into account the delivery uncertainty
	- Having trouble identifying the times for the ozone monitors because they look to be automated
	- Constructed rough interactive plots to identify calibration times
	- Running script and checking outputs to make sure they look reasonable
		- They do! There's a temperature concern with the Picarro, so changing the first zero to start a little later
- Now I have updated calibrations :)
# evaluate_offsets.py
- New script designed to assess different methods of determining offset
- Pulling code from calibrate_cleandata.py to get started
- Only evaluating offset for instruments that were on the trace gas line, and right now only doing 2025
	- Thermo, Picarro, O3, (later 2B NOx)
- Reading all data as lazyframes, that way it won't take too long because I won't collect until I'm using that particular data
- Going to concatenate all dates
- For all dates/sources, going to define offsets based on:
	- calibrations (fixed)
	- UZA measurements (interpolated)
	- Instrument temperature (estimated by correlation)
	- (All where available)
