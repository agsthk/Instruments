# evaluate_offset.py
- Picking up, need to apply the calibration LOD and noise-to-signal regression-based uncertainty, both of which have averaging time dependences
	- From cal_factors\[inst\], selecting the columns that contain LOD and NoiseSignal information, keeping CalDate and AveragingTime
	- Trying to think about how to add information for ALL cal dates, given the previously I only was joining with one of each averaging time selected
	- How do I select which one to use?
		- NoiseSignal - based on highest R2
		- LODs
			- By caldate when available, otherwise by highest value
			- Don't need to do LOD for ALL cals, can just use the date that I actually will use
	- Finished selecting appropriate values
- Adding manufacturer reported values
	- Actually very straightforward
	- Adding as "NoiseSignal_Slope/Offset_MFR" if equation given
	- Adding as FixedUnc_MFR or PercUnc_MFR otherwise
- Only thing remaining to add to the LazyFrames before comparison is the median values, which are based on the measured of the measured offset/LOD
	- Going to go back into the Interpolated cell to add these
		- Actually no - needs to be its own cell
	- Originally wrote a row iteration and then asked ChatGPT to fix it, so ended up with a cross join - going to check to ensure that it works on all LFs because the size is going to end up being VERY large
	- Removed the determination of zeroing active times for the time being - may reimplement later on
