# evaluate_offsets.py
- Left off with all possible offsets added to concatenated 2025 data
- Now, will actually calibrate the data using all possible offsets and sensitivities (where appropriate)
	- For fixed offset, apply sensitivity of the same calibration
	- For other offsets, check all sensitivities to see
- Added sensitivity columns to make it easier to calculate without having to go back into the calibration data
- First, uses fixed calibration offsets to calibrate data
- Then, for each calibration date, uses the UZA and Temperature correlation offsets to calibrate
- Now, will plot
	- A lot of data, so going to take this slowly and start by comparing the different fixed offsets
	- Even with this, plotting is taking a very long time - perhaps split by week?
		- Did that, and wrote script to plot both with matplotlib and hvplot - comment out the one that isn't desired
		- Also added skipping some instruments to make it faster to look at only one at a time
	- Fixed offsets
		- 2BTech_205_A
			- 20240119 calibration is a bit higher, but still only by ~0.8 ppb - within uncertainty
				- Other cals are closer together - almost on top of each other
					- Noteable that first cal was done with Farmer group cal source, all the other ones with Willis group cal source
				- Will be using 2025 cals anyway for this particular data
			- All basically the same within uncertainty, I believe differences are more likely due to difference in offset rather than sensitivity - more pronounced here than it will be using other methods of offset correction
		- 2BTech_205_B
			- Varies by ~0.8 ppb, again mostly consistent
		- Picarro_G2307
			- Varies by ~0.5 ppb at lower concentrations, when high by up to ~5 ppb
				- Again, may be more due to different offsets, although sensitivity was also quite different between the two cals
					- 2026-06-25 cal is more consistent with what would be expected, so probably going to chose that one
		- ThermoScientific_42i-TL
			- February 2024 cals are WAY different than July/December, unsurprising given first was SDC cal and second was with low N2O flow
			- Reliable cals are within ~1 ppb
				- I suspect other offset corrections will bring them closer together also
	- From examining fixed offset, determined that most cals are generally consistent with one another
		- 2BTech_205_A: Use 20250115
		- 2BTech_205_B: Use 20250115
		- Picarro_G2307: Use 20250625
		- ThermoScientific_42i-TL: Use 20241216
			- Need cal data for the cals Emma ran - later problem
	- Now, using the calibration date I have settled on looking at the different offsets
