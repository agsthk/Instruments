# evaluate_offsets.py
- Left off with all possible offsets added to concatenated 2025 data
- Now, will actually calibrate the data using all possible offsets and sensitivities (where appropriate)
	- For fixed offset, apply sensitivity of the same calibration
	- For other offsets, check all sensitivities to see
- Added sensitivity columns to make it easier to calculate without having to go back into the calibration data
- First, uses fixed calibration offsets to calibrate data
- Then, for each calibration date, uses the UZA and Temperature correlation offsets to calibrate
- Now, will plot
	- A lot of data, so going to take this slowly and start by comparing the different fixed offsets
	- Even with this, plotting is taking a very long time - perhaps split by week?
		- Did that, and wrote script to plot both with matplotlib and hvplot - comment out the one that isn't desired
		- Also added skipping some instruments to make it faster to look at only one at a time
