# evaluate_offset.py
- Wanting to visually check the median offsets and LODs against the measured values to ensure they seem reasonable
	- Plotting for Picarro is genuinely taking forever
	- Ozone looks fine
		- There is a temperature correlation for LOD that shouldn't be there - may have happened when I reran characterize_zeros.py, going to delete it
			- Will come back to the characterize_zeros.py script and set an R2 cutoff for exporting the temperature correlations
	- Thermo looks fine
	- They all look good!
- Adding code to calculate statistics comparing other methods of offset/LOD determination to UZA measurements during active zeroing periods
	- Plotting results week by week
	- Calculated min, max, lq, uq, and median of differences for each alternative method
	- Recognizing that this is not the best way to spend my time - will come back to this as I can, but need to move on to uncertainties
- Before uncertainties can be calculated, must calibrate data
	- Wrote code that I think works for this
- Now going to calculate uncertainties based on the calibrated data
	- Moving the manufacturer values cell after the calibration because that should make the DataFrames a little cleaner - not so much needed to be stored
		- In this cell, will calculate only manufacturer uncertainty
		- Will have separate uncertainty calculation after for the signal to noise regression
	- Adding a cell to calculate uncertainty based on regressions
- When comparing the manufacturer and regression based uncertainty, the regression based one is plenty reasonable and often seems to be better - will use that for all of them
# calibrate_cleandata.py
- Modifying this script to apply what I learned through evaluate_offset.py
- After modifying, set to export the calibrated data once more - now I have this finalized and can ICARTT!
# icartt_data.py
- Going to create a script to generate ICARTT files from the calibrated data - plan to pull a lot from existing ICARTT script, but need to modify to pull from YAML headers
- Creating YAML files - starting with 2BTech_205_A
	- Took forever actually but I did do it
- Now working on reading in the YAML files, looks like it worked fine
- Need to structure what was in the YAML files into an ICARTT header
- Also need to read in the relevant data
- Successfully have relevant data read in and concatenated
- Also able to convert datetime into seconds since midnight
- Taking the start and stop dates and getting those in the format needed for data collection and revision dates
- Actually was able to get the header together quite easily, and the data is also ready, so it's just a matter of exporting
	- Worked through that reasonably quickly and it all worked, going to run the data through the ICARTT checker and see what it says
- Before I check it, actually need to make sure I'm fixing the timestamps so that intervals don't overlap
- Will also need to fill the missing data with the Picarro, but leaving that for tomorrow
- Scanning is failing but I have no idea why
