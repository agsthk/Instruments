# calibrate_cleandata.py
- Working on applying the different methods of offset determination and expanding them to limit of detection as well
	- Also plan to revise the UZATemperatureCorrelation to include the STD correlation as appropriate, so plan to change the names in those files to be more clear
- As I'm going through this, going to add comments so I understand what the script is doing
- Added temperature correlation determination
- Added median determination
- Added fixed offset determination
- Removed temperature plotting code
- Plotting calibrated and uncalibrated data together to confirm it looks reasonable
	- 2BTech_205_A gets shifted up quite a bit, reasonable based on zeros always being ~0
	- 2BTech_205_B gets shifted down a little, looks fine I think
	- Picarro_G2307
		- Through Jan 28, there is no calibrated data - maybe the median didn't apply?
		- Where calibrated data was, worked well
	- ThermoScientific_42i-TL gets shifted down a little, NO background generally 0 ppb which is pretty much expected
	-
