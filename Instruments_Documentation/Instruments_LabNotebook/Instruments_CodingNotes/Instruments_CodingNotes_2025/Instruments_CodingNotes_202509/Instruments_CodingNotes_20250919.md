# calibrate_cleandata.py
- Working on applying the different methods of offset determination and expanding them to limit of detection as well
	- Also plan to revise the UZATemperatureCorrelation to include the STD correlation as appropriate, so plan to change the names in those files to be more clear
- As I'm going through this, going to add comments so I understand what the script is doing
- Added temperature correlation determination
- Added median determination
- Added fixed offset determination
- Removed temperature plotting code
- Plotting calibrated and uncalibrated data together to confirm it looks reasonable
	- 2BTech_205_A gets shifted up quite a bit, reasonable based on zeros always being ~0
	- 2BTech_205_B gets shifted down a little, looks fine I think
	- Picarro_G2307
		- Through Jan 28, there is no calibrated data - maybe the median didn't apply?
		- Where calibrated data was, worked well
	- ThermoScientific_42i-TL gets shifted down a little, NO background generally 0 ppb which is pretty much expected
- Discovered the problem with the median application
	- In this script, working with one day at a time, not with the whole time period as in evaluate_offset.py - median gives a null value
- Revising median application to take the median offset from the zero statistics instead of from the other values
	- While this doesn't take the interpolated values into account, I suspect that won't matter much
		- Will confirm in evaluation script
- The way I have this script structured, I have already applied interpolation and median filling of the standard deviation, so I just need to handle the temperature based one and the constant ones
	- Temperature based is straightforward-ish, just need a way to ensure I'm not applying non-existent correlation for O3 (R2 = 0.0093, maybe use a filter of R2 > 0.05?)
		- That's still a bad correlation but should take out the absolute worst ones?
		- This is something to look at in the characterize_zeros.py script - going to deal with later
		- For now! going to delete the O3 ~~figure and~~ data for temperature-noise correlation so it doesn't get read in
			- Keeping figure, that way I can confirm there is no correlation
- Revising correlation read in to read the current correlations as off_corr and added a new dictionary lod_corr for the std temperature correlations
	- Repeat the way I used off_corr, but with lod_corr for STD
- Quickly, looking to plot the standard deviation to ensure it looks reasonable
	- It is for sure using the offset correlation to calculate standard deviation - fixing
		- Was because when I copied the code from the offset determination, I didn't change it to pull from lod_corr, so it was just the offset again but labeled as STD
	- Fixed, but doesn't look super nice and continuous - that's fine, just makes me a little nervous (may need to return and check again sometime)
		- WRONG - this is because the calculation is to get LOD from temperature, NOT STD - need to convert the STD I have elsewhere to LOD before I do the temperature calculation
- Converting STD to LOD
	- Multiplying by 3 and renaming in interpolation
	- Directly going to LOD for temperature correlation
	- Multiplying median LOD by 3 and adding as that
	- Looks much better now!
