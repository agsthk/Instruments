- Working on applying the different methods of offset determination and expanding them to limit of detection as well
	- Also plan to revise the UZATemperatureCorrelation to include the STD correlation as appropriate, so plan to change the names in those files to be more clear

- Added temperature correlation determination
- Added median determination
- Added fixed offset determination
