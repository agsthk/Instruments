# align_timestamps.py
- Trying to correct Picarro time drift - wasn't working yesterday
	- Brought the Picarro data out of the loop to check that datetime offset was happening as I wanted
		- At this stage, it is
		- Based on a quick look at the figures, it now seems that I have corrected timestamp drift well enough
			- Method is correct even if value will later vary
- Now, want to go back into the UZA assignment and see if I can't figure out how to identify the first O3 point that measures UZA instead of the 2nd/3rd/whatever it was doing
	- Got it to identify only the first outlier as an outlier if there are consecutive outliers
	- But the second I bring it in to the actual processing loop it fails to identify outliers for 2BTech_205_A - this is the problem I was encountering yesterday
		- Broke it down - the issue arises when calculating rolling mean/std and resulting llim/ulum in the loop
			- It's the rolling mean/std
				- Calculating a standard deviation on the order of 10^23?
				- Genuinely I don't understand what's happening here - I'm using the exact same code that works outside of the loop
	- Going to break the processing loop to first get all the concatenated data, then have a loop to do the outlier/uza start/stop stuff, then partition by week
		- Still doing this, but I fear the issue may have had something to do with dropping nulls
			- It doesn't
		- Switching to use quantiles instead of mean/std
			- When I did this, seemed to work okay
	- FINALLY GOT IT TO WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		- Quick look at plots confirmed
			- Picarro is offset, but I believe that has to do with the offset correction - checking
				- It had to do with the number of IQR's being too low - changed it to 3, going to double check O3 and NOx to ensure that doesn't end up a problem
				- All good - keep it at 3
				- When I go back to applying offset correction, does something funky  - trying to apply but then use backward strategy to identify outliers
					- Mostly worked, but still don't like it much - commenting out the correction for time drift of picarro and continuing with the forward method
- Joining the UZA measurement times into one dataframe
- Revised plotting to work with the changes I made
- Offset of Picarro relative to 2BTech_205_A:
	- June 10 - June 17: 38 - 70 sec ahead
	- June 17 - June 18:  25 - 65 sec ahead
	- June 24 - July 1:  45 - 85 sec ahead
	- July 1 - July 8: 60 - 90 sec ahead
	- July 8 - July 15: 0 - 60 sec ahead
	- July 15 - July 21: 20 - 50 sec ahead
	- July 22 - July 29: 0 - 50 sec ahead
	- July 29 - July 31: 0 - 60 sec ahead
	- Aug 5 - Aug 12: 0-60 sec ahead
	- Aug 12: 4 - 70 sec ahead
	- These numbers aren't making a whole lot of sense to me - I feel like it should be around 2 minutes? Just visually speaking
	- I think 90 seconds is a good guess - apply tomorrow
