# icartt_data.py
- Trying to figure out the errors that are causing the ICARTT scanner to fail
- First, found that I didn't actually store the file with the updated start times, so fixed that
- Campaign dates are off for the YAML files - accidentally extended the room ozone to start too early instead of the vent ozone - fixed
- Other issue is that the number of normal comments is off - needs to increase by 1 - fixed
	- No clue why this is, maybe the header counts as a normal comment?
- Now the scanning is working! Still a few things to change though
- Need to filter to only include C200 data
- I think it may be a good idea to calculate the mid time - how to go about doing this?
	- Creates two new variables that need to get added to the header
	- Actually this is way too much work - not doing it, the mid point isn't necessary
- Do need to fill the missing values for Picarro
	- Actually need to adjust all timestamps if I can, the scanner doesn't like if times are even slightly more than 1 second apart
	- The RA data also fails the scanner which is cool so I don't have a reference for how I did this before
	- Did some complicated stuff but I do think it ended up working - time to test with the ICARTT scanner
		- Still encountering an error - going to attempt to round the timestamps before adjusting/ filling and see if that makes a difference
	- That wasn't the source of the error - it doesn't like when the difference is < 1 either, so need to revise script to make every difference exactly 1 I suppose
	- Need to change the rounding to every one second, that way I know they all end with .0 and won't flag in the ICARTT scanner (I hope)
		- IT WORKED !!!!!!!!!!!
		- Spoke too soon - didn't work with all of them, but that's because I overwrote the variable in the fixed header that all were using so the dates in the header didn't match the dates in the file name
	- Also had to fix filtering of data to just contain C200 rather than equaling C200, otherwise vent data disappears
	- Added a rounding to 1/10th of a second when files are read in to see if it stops yelling at me for "unusual" data
		- It did
- Trace gas ICARTT files are done and all passed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Next, need to ICARTT the files that weren't ever calibrated - should be straightforward to modify script to do this
# clean_rawdata.py
- There is an issue in here that is leading to the sampling locations not being assigned
	- Found the issue - the sampling stop is set to 1 year after sampling start, which doesn't work when the location never changes
	- Changing it to be 10 years - should be fine at that point (I hope)
		- Worked!
# icartt_data.py
- Adjusting code to take in clean data files if no calibrations were performed
- Appears to work just fine
	- Note - DO NOT POST VENT CO2!!! TIME OFFSET ISN'T CORRECTED!!!!
- The Aranet data in the past had all the sensors combined - I wonder how I can do that or if I even should?
- TempRHDoor data exported fine but didn't read fine
	- Ended up being an issue with the filling of null values - door status is an integer
	- Revised filling to proceed if data is integer values as well
