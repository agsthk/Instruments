- Picking up with the intention to use a hampel filter in combination with absolute d/dt
	- Examination follows the same structure/code as previously used
	- Added a secondary fraction of data removed to colorbar label to get a better idea of the amount of data removed
	- Set the minimum amount of data removed to 0 and the maximum amount to the original number of points/1 to facilitate intercomparison
		- A maximum of 1 may be too high, making it difficult to see differences given that the number of points removed doesn't get that high in general
		- The maximum is ~3%, so setting a maximum of 0.05
- I am not sure that just looking at the number of points is giving me the information that I want
	- This is difficult
- Visualizing what a filter based on median/interquartile range would look like
	- I like the hampel filter better - I think this is removing too much real data when the ozone rapidly changes
- Instead of just examining the number of data points, plotting what each filter looks like on the same figure (with subplots)
	- Hampel filter first
	- Also testing with interquartile range
	- Attempting to combine Hampel and IQR filters
- I wonder if I could use the rolling standard deviation of d/dt, take the rolling mean and standard deviation of that, and use that to filter?
	- This does not work well on its own
	- Could I combine this with another filter?
- Perhaps consider in steps
	- First, filter global outliers
		- e.g. -50
	- Then consider how to handle local outliers
	- Also need to confirm that I actually understand the Hampel filtering
- I will be using Hampel filtering
	- I need to decide if it will be in combination with another filter, or if it is sufficient on its own - this is where I will pick up next time
	- Also consider looping - apply the filter twice and see what that does
	- Quickly examining what a very large time window will do
	- What if I combine a Hampel filter with a short window with one with a long window?
	- I think I have determined the source of some of the issues for long times!
		- The rolling mean is calculated in the forward direction only
