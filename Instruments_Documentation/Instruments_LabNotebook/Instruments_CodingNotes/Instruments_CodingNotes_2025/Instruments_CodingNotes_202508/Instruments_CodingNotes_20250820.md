# calibrate_cleandata.py
- Working on joining the zeroing and data DataFrames
	- I think I may want to use concatenation rather than joining - otherwise not sure how I will interpolate at the start and end of the DataFrame
		- I suppose I could identify the times before and after the DataFrame starts/ends
		- Trying to use concatenation first, will return to joining if I am unsuccessful
- Successfully concatenated the zeroing and data DataFrames
	- Interpolated between zeros and filled with median values for measurements before or after zeroing occurs
	- May want to revise to change which data is considered when determining the median values
- Running the script to export data so that I can check in the KeckO3 project if the script did what I wanted it to
	- It did! Zero histograms are centered at zero and scatterplots don't show any noticeable drift
	- Average offset is <0.01, with standard deviation of <1 for all - looks good!
- Now, dropping UZA measurements since zeros are corrected for
- Some revisions I need to consider
	- When is applying zero offset not desired? think calibration data
	- Is a median of all offsets truly appropriate?
		- Should I use a time constraint to only use data within a certain range, and if there is none do no time offset?
	- How do I handle limit of detection when not zeroing?
# calibrate_instruments.py
- Need to define an uncertainty using the signal to noise ratio during calibration - combining with calibration script, will likely revise result outputs to include the uncertainty
- Beginning with visualization
	- Only one of these shows a clear linear relationship, so I'm a bit confused on what I should be doing here
- Checking the noise on the zero calibration
- Still not sure what I'm doing here, but I have figures to run by Megan and ask her about at the very least
	- Saving plots to appropriate folder
# Next steps
- Revise the sampling location assignment, ensure non-logged zeros are included, check data filtering
- Record all events over both campaigns to use with filtering
	- For now, can focus on ozone, CO2, and citrus peeling
- Prepare Phase II ICARTT files
	- Do not upload - will need to change a couple of things first
- Compare pre- and post-fixing leak measurements to establish a systematic relative error
	- Phase II files
