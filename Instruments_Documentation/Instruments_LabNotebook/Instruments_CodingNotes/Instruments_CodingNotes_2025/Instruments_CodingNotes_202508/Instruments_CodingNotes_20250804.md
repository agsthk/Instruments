# calibrate_instruments.py
- Revised to add calibration factors to dictionary keyed by species for each date, then added to dictionary keyed by date, then finally to dictionary keyed by instrument
- Trying to recall where I was at with this and what I wanted to do
	- Beyond revising calibration inputs
- Using hvplot to generate interactive plots to revise the calibration intervals
	- Want to comment on any changes from documentation, but not completely sure how I wish to do that
	- Revising based on visual appearance
	- Setting SDC uncertainty to ~10% of the value (best guess)
		- 2 ppb for UZA
- Manually setting the start/stop points works well and is relatively straightforward
	- Even though it was time consuming in this instance, it shouldn't be so for only one calibration at a time (especially if I document better)
- Pulled from previous scripts to handle making the figures look nicer
- While trying to save the figures I created, I discovered that my path name is too long! Resultsin a FileNotFoundError when trying to use fig.savefig()
	- Trying to determine if there is a way around this
	- I suspect I will need to reconsider my current file naming structure
		- This is very sad because I was happy with it in its current state
- Tomorrow, need to evaluate how I can address this problem
