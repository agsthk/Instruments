- Examining failure of ODR regression for formaldehyde data
	- This is tied to the variable uncertainty in delivery concentration - it works if this uncertainty is set to none or a constant value
	- This was an issue previously, I though that scipy had maybe resolved it since the other calibrations with variable delivery uncertainties ran with no issue
	- Will need to downgrade scipy version, need to check back in my notes/previous environments to determine which version
	- After reviewing notes, it may be an issue with an uncertainty of 0
	- Previous scipy version that I know worked was 1.11.2, current version is 1.16.0
	- It is the zero uncertaity that is a problem - if I fit excluding the zero point, then it works fine even with variable uncertainty
		- No need to downgrade as far as I can tell
	- Replacing the zero uncertainty with None does not work, but replacing it with a really small value (1e-15) does work
	- This issue is resolved
- Now need to consider NOx calibrations
	- Do not want to calibrate NO using NO2 calibration steps - how to remove those?
- Revising the grouping to create groups that consider the values of all delivery concentrations
	- Such that NO2 = 0 isn't considered a true zero when NO != 0
- I want to consider how I could use functions to calibrate the instruments
