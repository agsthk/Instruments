# icartt_data.py
- Need to fix precision here - report uncertainties to 2 significant figures, use those to determine precision on readings
- Creating R3 files for 2BTech_205_A for CITRUS
- There is a round_sig_figs function in polars which is epic, using that when we have uncertainty columns
	- Then I think the next step is to determine precision from the sig figs but that is a bit more challenging
	- The round_sig_figs function actually isn't great because if I round to 2 sig figs and the second significant digit is a 0, it drops it
- Figured out a way that multiplies by ten to some power, rounds to integer, then divides by 10 to the same power
	- The power is determined by the difference in position between the first non-zero digit and the decimal point
- Ran updated script on ozone data and it appeared to work
	- Additional problem: after adjusting ICARTT timestamps, some of them are reading as 0.6999999999999 or something like that, so maybe I want to fix that
		- Probably not as important?
