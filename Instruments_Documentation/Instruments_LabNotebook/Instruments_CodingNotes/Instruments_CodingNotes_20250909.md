# characterize_zeros.py
- Noticed yesterday that there were some zeros with a null standard deviation - assume that means not enough points
- Going to revise to not calculate mean/std if number of points is too small (2 or less?)
- Joined the grouped dataframe with a dataframe that counts the number of items in each group, then filtered out zero intervals with 2 or fewer rows
	- Ensures all zero intervals have a standard deviation calculated
- I want to look at the cell temperature versus zero - won't want to keep this, but do want figures
- Creating a branch uza_temps
- Going to plot the mean zero value against the instrument temperature and see if there is a correlation
	- Absolutely there is!
	- Positive for Thermo, negative for O3
	- Will run an ODR to get an idea of the correlation slope
- Have ODR results for Thermo and 2B 205A
	- Picarro no clear correlation, but also never deployed without zeroing so not a concern
- Only using the 2025 zeros because I know that my sampling locations aren't all correct for 2024
- Would it be useful to export these results? Probably
- Revised code to create a correlation file to export
	- Same location as the UZA statistics files
# calibrate_instruments.py
- I want to take the S/N that I determined and add it to calibration results output
- Straightforward given it was already calculated, I just needed to add it to the output files
	- Checked and doing so was successful
